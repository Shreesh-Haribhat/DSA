Given an integer array and another integer element, your task is to find if the given element is present in the array or not.

### Example 1

**Input:**
- `n = 4`
- `arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}`
- `x = 3`

**Output:**
- `2`

**Explanation:**
There is one test case with an array as {1, 2, 3, 4} and an element to be searched as 3. Since 3 is present at index 2, the output is 2.

### Example 2

**Input:**
- `n = 5`
- `arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- `x = 5`

**Output:**
- `4`

**Explanation:**
For array elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, the element to be searched is 5, and it is at index 4. So, the output is 4.

### Your Task

The task is to complete the function `search()` which takes the array `arr[]`, its size `N`, and the element `X` as inputs and returns the index of the first occurrence of `X` in the given array. If the element `X` does not exist in the array, the function should return -1.

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^6`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
- `0 <= x <= 10^5`

### Expected Time Complexity

- O(n)

### Expected Auxiliary Space

- O(1)
